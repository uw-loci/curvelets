# Curvelet-Transform based fibrillar collagen quantification (CurveAlign and CT-FIRE)
This software package includes two tools, i.e. CurveAlign[1-4] and CT-FIRE[5-6] for collagen fiber quantification. CurveAlign is a curvelet transform (CT)[7]-based quantitative tool for interpreting the regional interaction between collagen and tumors by assessment of up to ~thirty fiber features, including angle, alignment, and density. CT-FIRE analyzes individual fiber metrics such as length, width, angle, and curvature. The individual fibers extracted by CT-FIRE can be imported into the CurveAlign as one of the two fiber analyse modes. The approach of CT-FIRE is described in [5], which combines the advantages of the fast discrete curvelet transform for denoising images, enhancement of the fiber edge features, and the fiber extraction (FIRE) algorithm [6] for extracting individual fibers.  For now, CurveAlign should be used for bulk assessment of collagen features including angles/density and CT-FIRE for individual fiber quantification.

Since the release in 2020, we have been adding new features, mainly including 1) Bio-Formats importer/exporter to enhance image format support; 2) auto-threshold for CT-FIRE to optionally apply different thresholds for image stack or images from different acquisition settings; 3) fiber intersection points calculation based on CT-FIRE fiber extraction; 4) ROI based fiber density analysis; 5) deep learning based cell-fiber analysis. We have started running python-based deep learning modules for individual cell analysis which is integrated to the MATLAB-based fiber analysis pipeline to quantify the fiber-cell/tumor interactions.

A quick manual to a cell-based fiber and tumor analysis module for the newest version CurveAlign 6.0 can be [found here (testing only for now)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qi66Pj96mGjN_wjRn63i6SkiCuej_wvhIKAEdCIC7S8/edit?usp=sharing).
An illustration of three relative measurements between fibers and associated annotation(can be tumor, cell, and any ROI) is shown below.
