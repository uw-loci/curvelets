function stats = makeStats(vals,tempFolder,imgName,map,tr,ty,tg,bdryMeas,numImPts)

% makeStats.m - writes histogram data out for a batch processed group of files. 
%   This was created to fulfill a specific need of the Keely lab.
% 
% Inputs:
%   vals        = a column vector of angles (0-90 deg if bdryMeas, 0-180 if ~bdryMeas)
%   tempFolder  = the output folder
%   imgName     = the name of the original image file
%   map         = the 2D map image for counting pixels crossing thresholds
%   tr, ty, tg  = red, yellow and green thresholds respectively
%   bdryMeas    = flag indicating if the measurement is wrt a boundary
%   numImPts    = total number of image points that were evaluated 
%
% Output:
%   stats = array of floating point values
